<h1> Least Favorite Foods </h1>

Here are some of the not so good or bad foods at Echo Lake. Some of these foods I probaly don't like as well.




<ul>
<li> cran-apple turkey wraps "What makes them so bad, is that they combine cranberries and apples with turkey into a wrap." </li>
 <li> french toast "I like french toast out of camp, but the camp's french toast is so bland!" </li>
 <li> breakfast burrito "Mexican food is good, but for breakfast?"  </li>
 <li> chicken and Mexican rice wraps "I heard people say now there good, but I still hate them!" </li>
 <li> meatloaf "Meatloaf is disgusting, but this meatloaf is 1,000 times as disgusting!" </li>
 <li> egg-mc muffins "There alright, not great." </li>
  </ul>
