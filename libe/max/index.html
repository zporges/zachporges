		<h1> SSA Bears </h1>
			<p> At the beginning of the year of 2013-2014, Solomon Schechter Academy has 				managed to build their first hockey team. There were three tryouts and 						everyone was very excited. At 7:00 every Tuesday morning the players used all 				of their energy. The team was made and the bears were excited for a great 					year! </p>
			<p> After many practices of excitement and effort for their first season, the 				players arrived at their home arena, ready for a great start. Hard work came out 			of the players during the first half of the season however they did not end up 				with having a win. Still with very high spirits, The Bears had two weeks of 				vacation to prepare for part two of season one. The first three times on the ice 			after their break, they realized that they have improved a lot since the their 				first game.  The season was over and The Bears have made the playoffs! They got 			two very exciting wins to snag fourth place over LCC and Royal Vale. Not being a 			surprise, The Bears lost in the semi finals to the champion team. The SSA Bears 			knew that they did way better than they all thought that they would and left the 			locker room with their heads up. The Bears have bonded so fast and they are 				looking forward to next season. Stay fierce. Bears pride! </p> 
			<p> GO BEARS GO!!! </p>
