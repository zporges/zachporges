				Q:Who is the best PG In the NBA?
			</p>
			<p class="answer">
				A:If this were 3 years ago I would say D-Rose but he's gotten injured a lot with a torn ACL and torn Achilles and when he comes back I don't think he will be better, so I will say Chris Paul, he is a great passer and amazing scorer, he plays the position like it was meant to be played.
