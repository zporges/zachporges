		<br />Abstract
		</h3>
		<p>
			<br />In today’s technological society, individuals are in constant communication via computers and mobile devices. However, while technology is making it easier for us to stay in contact, computers are inherently incapable of conveying and interpreting emotions effectively. The expression of emotion plays an essential role in communication, so it is vital to determine ways in which this can be accomplished digitally. EmotionSelect, a Java web applet, was developed by the student investigator to explore the capability of individuals to correctly identify emotions conveyed by digital images. The applet displays groups of images which were tagged on Flickr.com with one of thirty emotions. There were 52 users, and each observed 25 such groups. They were asked to select which one of eight emotions was best represented by each group of photos. Emotions were divided into four quadrants: positive valence (pleasure) and high arousal (intensity), positive valence and low arousal, negative valence and low arousal, and negative valence and high arousal. The correct emotion, quadrant, arousal, and valence were selected 47%, 59%, 71%, and 80% of the time, respectively. These results demonstrate with statistical significance that individuals were able to interpret the emotions displayed (p=5.80x10^-295), suggesting that computers and mobile devices can accurately convey emotions with pictures. With this enhanced understanding, computer scientists and engineers will be able to improve technology-mediated social interaction, social support, worker productivity, and marketing. Future studies are needed to evaluate ways in which this knowledge can be applied towards the improvement of digital communication.

		<h2>Research</h2>
		<p>
			<br />During the summer of 2009, before my senior year of high school, I conducted a research study at Cornell's Interaction Design Lab. To the right, you can see a sample screenshot of the web applet that I developed for the study. I am planning to continue doing research in the near future.
